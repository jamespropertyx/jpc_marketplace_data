    "description": "This 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom mid-terraced house in Hull benefits from front and rear gardens and is currently vacant, giving an investor immediate control over the chosen strategy. The property lends itself to two clear investment routes: a “let & forget” model following light refurbishment, aimed at steady long-term rental income with minimal management, or a fully optimised student or professional rental setup after a full refurbishment to maximise rental levels and capitalise on strong local demand. This flexibility makes the property suitable for both hands-off income investors and those targeting higher-yield optimisation.",

The property sits within easy reach of Hull City Centre and local amenities, making it suitable for working professionals, couples, or small families. This asset presents a clear example of how light refurbishment choices can influence both income and management intensity. With a modest level of spend, the property could be positioned as a “let and forget” rental. Alternatively, with a more comprehensive refurbishment and furnishing, there may be scope to optimise rental income, subject to demand and compliance. Both routes appear viable in principle, depending on investor preference.",

The property is currently a vacant family home but is well-suited to a social housing setup with minimal works. With a light refurbishment it can be placed immediately into a stable, long-term tenancy. The location benefits from strong transport links, proximity to major employment zones, and consistent rental demand. The second option is a full refurbishment, upgrading the entire property to a modern specification. This includes updating the kitchen, bathroom, flooring, decor, and internal finishes throughout. Once fully improved, the property becomes suitable for professional tenants and can be configured for a room-by-room letting model.",

    "description": "This 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom property is located in one of Hull's most reliable rental areas for both students and social housing providers, positioned close to Newland Avenue. Internally the house is in very good condition, requiring only a light refurbishment to bring it to a strong lettable standard. The property is fully suitable for social housing placements with no additional works required, and with a furniture pack added it becomes an attractive student let option. Demand in this area remains consistently high due to its proximity to key amenities, strong transport links, and the University of Hull.",

For investors seeking higher returns, there is also potential to carry out a full refurbishment and convert the property into a 3-bed Hybrid BTL, targeting mature students or professionals. This route would require planning approval and a full modernisation but would significantly increase rental income and future refinance value.",

Currently vacant and in very good condition, it is ready to rent immediately to 2 tenants with minimal input. However, it also offers strong potential to add value through conversion into a 3-bed, 2-en-suite student HMO, an attractive opportunity in the high-demand HU5 market.",
